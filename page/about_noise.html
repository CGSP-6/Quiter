          <p> Noise, defined as unwanted or excessive sound, has been considered a pollutant since 1972, according to World Health Organization (WHO). 
              Also, it is the second largest environmental health risk in Western Europe by the report published by WHO in 2011. </p>

          <p> When the limits provided in A-weighted decibels (dBA) by The United States National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are taken into consideration, 
              at or below 70 dBA sounds are generally considered safe, while sounds at or above 85 dBA may cause hearing loss. Alongside the sound levels, exposure time is another cardinal factor for safety. 
              The first recommended exposure limit (REL) for occupational noise exposure was offered by The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in 1972. 
              The latest REL revised in 1998 is an 8-hour time-weighted average using a 3-dB exchange rate . As shown in the figure below, noise level and exposure time are exponential. </p>

          <p> The relationship between green spaces and noise exposure has been researched from various aspects.</p>
          </div>
          <h2><div class= "container">Research Questions</div></h2>
          <p> Following are three research questions were addressed as the main frame of this study.<br>
            RQ-1: What are the benefits of green spaces for noise reduction?<br> 
            RQ-2: What is the importance of commute-based noise measurements?<br>
            RQ-3: Can green spaces aid in noise reduction while commuting?<br></p>
          <h2><div class= "container">Hypotheses</div></h2>
          <p>Consequently, the aims are to provide the effectiveness of green spaces for noise reduction in public areas; the comparison point-based and commute-based noise measurements with their differences; noise reduction effects of green spaces on commutes. Lastly, three hypotheses were defined in this study.<br>
            H-1: Green spaces attenuate noise levels in public areas.<br>
            H-2: Commute-based measurements are more representative than point-based ones.<br>
            H-3: Commuting through green spaces reduces your exposure to noise.</p>

            <h2><div class= "container">Study Area</div></h2>    
            <div style= "text-align: justify;">
              <p> The Meadows occupy 58.4 acres (22.032 hectares). The Meadows remain one of Edinburgh's most important open spaces and one of the most popular. The Meadows on one side adjacent to the accommodation area, adjacent to the lane, provide unique conditions for detecting noise pollution Through data and the suppression of green space for noise pollution.

              The princess street garden separates the Old Town from the New Town. The gardens are over 37 acres (150.000 m2) and are divided into two parts by The Mound. an artificial hill that connects Edinburgh's New Town and Old Town and where the Scottish National Gallery is located; because of its exceptional geographical environment and high greening rate. 
              It is one of the areas that can most reflect.</p>

          <p style= "text-align: justify;"> Generally, it is divided into 6 people or single people and collects them in different time periods. 
            Due to the continuous improvement of our understanding, we have repeatedly revised the way we collect data.</p>
         
        </div>
          <h2><div class= "container">Instrumentation and Equipment</div></h2>
          <p style= "text-align: justify;"> We used the weather meters to record the wind speed and humidity. To record and manage our study area points, we used the application Map Plus.
             It allows custom online and offline maps to be added and viewed and supports all widely used offline maps as well as all popular online maps like Google Maps, Bing Maps, and OSM.
              It has an in-built GPS feature which we used to track the travelling routes we studied. It lets you export data to files of KML, GPX, etc., and share these files to iCloud, Email, or save them on your desktop computer.
               Additionally, to record the noise levels we used the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH) Sound Level Meter app which provides a readout of the sound level using the built-in microphone (or external microphone if used) and reports the instantaneous sound level in A, C, or Z-weighted decibels. 
               It also reports the main metrics that are of importance for proper occupational noise measurements – mainly the run time (total time), the A-weighted Equivalent Sound Level (LAeq), which we used in our study.</p>
