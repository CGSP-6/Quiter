          <div style= "text-align: justify;">
          <p> Noise, defined as unwanted or excessive sound, has been considered a pollutant since 1972, according to World Health Organization (WHO). 
              Also, it is the second largest environmental health risk in Western Europe by the report published by WHO in 2011. </p>

          <p> When the limits provided in A-weighted decibels (dBA) by The United States National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are taken into consideration, 
              at or below 70 dBA sounds are generally considered safe, while sounds at or above 85 dBA may cause hearing loss. Alongside the sound levels, exposure time is another cardinal factor for safety. 
              The first recommended exposure limit (REL) for occupational noise exposure was offered by The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in 1972. 
              The latest REL revised in 1998 is an 8-hour time-weighted average using a 3-dB exchange rate . As shown in the figure below, noise level and exposure time are exponential. </p>

          <p> The relationship between green spaces and noise exposure has been researched from various aspects.</p>
          <h2><div class= "container">Research Questions</div></h2>
          <p> Following are three research questions were addressed as the main frame of this study.<br>
            RQ-1: What are the benefits of green spaces for noise reduction?<br> 
            RQ-2: What is the importance of commute-based noise measurements?<br>
            RQ-3: Can green spaces aid in noise reduction while commuting?<br></p>
          <h2><div class= "container">Hypotheses</div></h2>
          <p>Consequently, the aims are to provide the effectiveness of green spaces for noise reduction in public areas; the comparison point-based and commute-based noise measurements with their differences; noise reduction effects of green spaces on commutes. Lastly, three hypotheses were defined in this study.<br>
            H-1: Green spaces attenuate noise levels in public areas.<br>
            H-2: Commute-based measurements are more representative than point-based ones.<br>
            H-3: Commuting through green spaces reduces your exposure to noise.</p>
